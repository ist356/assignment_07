cleaning.py — Part 1, Step 1: turn scraped text into clean values.

A scraper hands you whatever the page shows a person, and pages are written for
people. Lakeshore Lattes' menu cards are a good example — `inner_text()` on one
card gives you:

    NEW!
    Matcha Latte
    V
    S $5.05 · L $6.25
    Ceremonial-grade matcha whisked with steamed milk.

A badge, a dietary tag, two sizes and two prices crammed onto one line. These
functions turn that into rows a DataFrame can hold. They are plain Python — no
browser — so they are quick to test and quick to fix.

Every café names its drink sizes S, M and L (Lakeshore pours only S and L); food
has one price, which we call "Each".

This step is walked through line by line. The scrapers give you less help.

    - `.strip()` each line. Skip it if it is empty.
    - Skip it if every word in it is in NOISE: `all(w in NOISE for w in line.split())`.
    - Otherwise append it to a list, and return the list.

    How to build it:

    - `re.findall(r"([SML])?\\s*(\\$[\\d.,]+)", line)` finds every price, and the
      size letter in front of it if there is one. Each match is a tuple
      (size, price), with size "" when there is none.
    - Loop over the matches. Use "Each" when size is "", and `clean_price()` on the
      price. Return the list of pairs.

    How to build it:

    - `clean_card_lines()` the text. The first line is the item's name. The price
      line is the first line with a "$" in it — usually the second, but don't
      count on it.
    - `parse_price_line()` the price line, and build one dict per (size, price)
