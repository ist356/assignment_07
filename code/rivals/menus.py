"""
menus.py — Part 1, Step 3: three scrapes and our own menu, as one dataset.

The scrapers return lists of dicts in each café's own words. This step makes them
one table everyone downstream can trust — the same columns for every café, and
every category labelled a drink or a food:

    cafe  category  kind  item  size  price

(Every café uses the same sizes — S, M, L for drinks, "Each" for food — so there
is nothing to translate.)

Our own menu (data/salt_city_menu.csv) goes in the same table, under
"Salt City Coffee", so comparing prices later is one table, not two.

No walkthrough here: the docstrings say what each function returns, and
tests/test_pipeline.py says how it is checked.
