"""
scrapers.py — Part 1, Step 2: one scraper per rival café.

Each scraper is handed a Playwright `page` (an open browser tab) and returns a
list of dicts, one per menu item *and size*, all with the same keys:

    {"cafe": ..., "category": ..., "item": ..., "size": ..., "price": ...}

Every café names its drink sizes S, M and L — Lakeshore pours only S and L — and
food has one price, "Each".

The three sites are built differently on purpose, so each scraper uses a
different technique from Unit 5. Before you write one, open the café in Chrome
(settings.cafe_url) and right-click → Inspect the parts you need.

The steps are described in words. You write the code.

def scrape_lakeshore(page) -> list[dict]:
    """Lakeshore Lattes: section headings, each followed by a grid of menu cards.

    Returns card_rows() for every card — one row per size.

    The page, simplified:

        <h2 class="menu-section__title">Tea & More</h2>
        <p class="menu-section__note">Swap in oat milk for 60¢.</p>
        <div class="menu-grid">
            <article class="menu-card"> ... </article>
            ...

    How to build it:

    - `page.goto(cafe_url("Lakeshore Lattes"))`.
    - For each heading in `page.query_selector_all("h2.menu-section__title")`:
        - its `inner_text()` is the category.
        - the grid is a *later sibling* of the heading — `heading.query_selector("~
          div.menu-grid")` (lesson 5-2's `~` selector; `~ *` would find the note).
        - for each `article.menu-card` in the grid: `card_rows("Lakeshore Lattes",
          category, card.inner_text())` — add its rows to your list.
    - Return all the rows in one list. (The cards have photos; you don't need them.)

def scrape_hilltop(page) -> list[dict]:
    """Hilltop Grind: inside `<div id="menu">`, an `<h2>` and a `<table>` per category.

    Drink tables have a column per size; food tables have one "Each" column:

        Item           Description                  S      M      L

    How to build it:

    - `page.goto(cafe_url("Hilltop Grind"))`.
    - The categories: the `inner_text()` of every `#menu h2` (an id selector), in order.
    - The tables: `pd.read_html(StringIO(page.content()))` reads every `<table>` on
      the page into a list of DataFrames, in the same order as the headings.
    - For each (category, table) pair (`zip()`): drop the "Description" column, then
      `.melt()` the table so each size column becomes rows — `id_vars="Item",
      var_name="size", value_name="price"`.
    - Turn each melted row into a dict with the five keys; `clean_price()` the price.

def scrape_canal(page, shop: str = CANAL_SHOP) -> list[dict]:
    """Canal Street Coffee: an order-ahead app. The menu is not in the HTML.

    A person has to choose a shop, ask for the menu, and click "Show more" until
    every item is listed. The list shows only names — each item's sizes and
    prices are on its own page. The page's JavaScript draws all of it, slowly,
    so your code has to wait for it.

    How to build it (`playwright codegen <the url>` will write the first three
    steps for you — click through the page and copy what it records):

    - `page.goto(cafe_url("Canal Street Coffee"))`.
    - Choose the shop: `page.get_by_label("Choose your shop").select_option(shop)`.
    - Click the "Show full menu" button (`page.get_by_role("button", name=...)`),
      then `page.wait_for_selector("a.result-card")` — the cards appear after a delay.
    - While the "Show more" button `is_visible()`: count the cards
      (`page.locator("a.result-card").count()`), click it, and wait until there
      are more — `page.wait_for_function(f"document.querySelectorAll(
      'a.result-card').length > {count}")`.
    - Collect every card's `get_attribute("href")` — the link to its item page.
    - For each link: `page.goto(urljoin(cafe_url("Canal Street Coffee"), href))`,
      `page.wait_for_selector("#sizes")`, then read `#item-name`, the category
      (the text of `#item-category` before " · "), and one row per
      `#sizes tbody tr` — its two `td` cells are the size and the price.
