"""
matching.py — Part 2: which of their items are ours?

Lakeshore calls it a "Caffe Mocha", Hilltop a "Mocha Cappuccino", Canal Street a
"Mochaccino", and we call it a "Mocha Latte". Before anyone can compare prices,
every rival item needs one name — ours when it is something we sell, its own
when it is not.

No score can do that alone. Fuzzy matching scores how alike two *strings* are, not
whether two *drinks* are the same: "Matcha Latte" scores 87 against "Mocha Latte"
and is a different drink; "PSL" scores 0 against "Pumpkin Spice Latte" and is the
same one. So the code proposes and the owner decides:

- a score of settings.AUTO_MATCH or more is matched automatically;
- anything lower waits for the owner, who sees the top suggestions on the Review
  page and picks one, or says it is a new item;
- the owner's decisions are saved (data/item_matches.csv) and win every time,
  so next month's scrape does not ask the same questions again.

The steps are described in words. You write the code.

      a space: `re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9 ]+", " ", text)`.

    - `process.extract(normalized_name, normalized_choices,
      scorer=fuzz.token_sort_ratio, limit=limit)` returns (match, score, index)

def match_items(menus: pd.DataFrame, decisions: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """One row per rival item: what it is called on our list, and who decided.

    `menus` is the dataset from build_dataset; `decisions` is data/item_matches.csv
    (columns `cafe`, `item`, `matched_to`). Returns, one row per distinct
    (`cafe`, `item`) that is not ours, in the order they first appear in `menus`:

        cafe  item  kind  status  matched_to  score  suggestions

    - `suggestions`: top_candidates(item, the names on the list so far of the same
      `kind`) — a list of (name, score) pairs. `score` is the first pair's score
      (0 when there are no suggestions).
    - `status` and `matched_to`:
        - "owner" when the owner has decided this (cafe, item): `matched_to` is
          their answer — or the item's own name when they answered NEW_ITEM.
        - otherwise "auto" when `score` is AUTO_MATCH or more: the top suggestion.
        - otherwise "unreviewed", and `matched_to` is None.

    "The list" starts as our own item names (with their kinds) and grows: an item
    that ends up matched to a name not yet on the list adds it. That is how
    Lakeshore's "Avocado Toast" — not ours — becomes the name Hilltop's
    "Avocado Toast" matches. Unreviewed items add nothing.

    How to build it (nearly line by line):

    - The list so far: `ours` <- the rows of `menus` whose cafe is OUR_CAFE.
      `pool = dict(zip(ours["item"], ours["kind"]))` — {name: kind}.
    - The owner's answers: `answers` — a dict {(cafe, item): matched_to}, one
      entry per row of `decisions` (loop over `decisions.to_dict("records")`).
    - The rival items, once each, in order: `theirs` <- the rows of `menus` whose
      cafe is *not* OUR_CAFE; `rivals = theirs[["cafe", "item", "kind"]]
      .drop_duplicates()`.
    - `rows = []`, then `for cafe, item, kind in rivals.itertuples(index=False):`
        - `choices` <- the names in `pool` whose kind equals `kind`
          (a list comprehension over `pool.items()`).
        - `suggestions = top_candidates(item, choices)`;
          `score` <- `suggestions[0][1]` if there are any suggestions, else 0.
        - Decide, in this order:
            - `(cafe, item)` is in `answers`: status "owner"; `matched_to` is the
              answer — or `item` itself when the answer is NEW_ITEM.
            - else `score >= AUTO_MATCH`: status "auto"; `matched_to` is the top
              suggestion's name, `suggestions[0][0]`.
            - else: status "unreviewed"; `matched_to = None`.
        - Grow the list: if `matched_to` is not None and not already in `pool`,
          `pool[matched_to] = kind`.
        - `rows.append({...})` with the seven keys.
    - `return pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=[...the seven columns...])` — naming the
      columns keeps them in order.
